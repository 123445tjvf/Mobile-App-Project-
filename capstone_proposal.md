# Capstone Project Proposal: VVU Student Marketplace
**Student Name:** Zadok Nana Kwasi Akpah
**Course:** INFT 425 – Mobile Application Development

## 1. Project Overview
The VVU Student Marketplace is a mobile application designed specifically for students at Valley View University to buy, sell, or trade items like textbooks, electronics, and hostel supplies within the campus community.

## 2. The Problem
Students often struggle to find affordable second-hand items or sell their old belongings when leaving campus. Current social media groups are cluttered. This app provides a dedicated, safe space for VVU transactions.

## 3. Key Features (Week 4 - Week 12)
* **User Authentication**: Students sign in with their VVU email.
* **Item Listings**: Users can upload photos, prices, and descriptions of items.
* **Search & Filter**: Search for items by category (e.g., "Books" or "Electronics").
* **Favorites List**: Users can save items they are interested in (using StatefulWidget).
* **Contact Seller**: A button to email or call the seller directly.

## 4. Technical Stack
* **Frontend**: Flutter
* **State Management**: StatefulWidget and Provider
* **Database**: Firebase Firestore (for real-time listings)
